# SAD BROWSER
  Web-browser in python 

This application is a python app that uses the QtPy library and the PyQt5 packge. 

I did this project invisioning an documentation project, getting and existing docs and displaying as a new thing. It would be easy to just access the older docs then to write a new one or try to convert or maybe read the files.
